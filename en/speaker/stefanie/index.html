                Stefanie Posavec is a designer for whom data is her favoured material, with projects ranging from data visualization and information design to commissioned data art. This work has been exhibited internationally at major galleries.<br>
                 She recently completed an award-winning, year-long data-drawing project with Giorgia Lupi called Dear Data, and a book of this project is published both in the US and UK. The 104 postcards and sketchbooks that form the project are held in the permanent collection of MoMA, New York.
